## 2. Database Architecture (3 minutes)

### Database Schema Overview
> "Let me start by showing you the database architecture. We have 7 main tables..."

**Open pgAdmin or show schema.sql**

#### Tables (Point to each)
```sql
1. branches       - Bank branch information
2. customers      - Customer accounts with authentication
3. employees      - Branch staff records
4. accounts       - Bank accounts with balance constraints
5. transactions   - All financial transactions
6. audit_logs     - Automatic balance change tracking
7. recovery_logs  - Failed operation logging
```

> "Notice the comprehensive use of constraints..."

#### Constraints Demonstration
```sql
-- Show CHECK constraint
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD CONSTRAINT chk_balance_non_negative 
CHECK (balance >= 0.00);

-- Show FOREIGN KEY
CONSTRAINT fk_account_customer FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) 
    REFERENCES customers(customer_id)

-- Show UNIQUE
email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
```

### ER Diagram (If you have one)
> "The relationships between these tables ensure data integrity through foreign keys and cascade rules."

---

## 3. Advanced DBMS Features (5 minutes)

### Feature #1: Trigger (Automatic Auditing)

> "Let me demonstrate our automatic auditing system using PostgreSQL triggers."

**Show code in schema.sql:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_account_update()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_logs (account_id, old_balance, new_balance, operation_type)
    VALUES (OLD.account_id, OLD.balance, NEW.balance, 'BALANCE_UPDATE');
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_account_balance_audit
BEFORE UPDATE ON accounts
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (OLD.balance IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.balance)
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_account_update();
```

> "This trigger automatically fires BEFORE any balance update, logging the old and new values. This is crucial for compliance and audit trails."

### Feature #2: Stored Procedure (Atomic Transfers)

> "Now, the core of our system - the fund transfer stored procedure with built-in transaction management."

**Show code:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION transfer_funds(
    p_sender_account_id INTEGER,
    p_receiver_account_id INTEGER,
    p_amount NUMERIC
)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
    v_sender_balance NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    -- Lock rows for update
    SELECT balance INTO v_sender_balance
    FROM accounts WHERE account_id = p_sender_account_id
    FOR UPDATE;
    
    -- Check insufficient funds
    IF v_sender_balance < p_amount THEN
        -- Log to recovery_logs
        INSERT INTO recovery_logs (...)
        VALUES (...);
        
        -- Raise exception to trigger ROLLBACK
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Insufficient funds...';
    END IF;
    
    -- Perform transfer
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - p_amount 
    WHERE account_id = p_sender_account_id;
    
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + p_amount 
    WHERE account_id = p_receiver_account_id;
    
    -- Record transaction
    INSERT INTO transactions (...) VALUES (...);
    
    RETURN 'Transfer successful';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

> "Key points: Row-level locking with FOR UPDATE, automatic rollback on error, and comprehensive error logging to recovery_logs."

### Feature #3: Database Views

> "For reporting, we use database views that pre-compute aggregations."

**Show views:**
```sql
-- Customer Financial Overview
CREATE VIEW customer_financial_overview AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS full_name,
    COUNT(a.account_id) AS total_accounts,
    SUM(a.balance) AS total_balance
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN accounts a ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name;

-- Branch Transaction Summary
CREATE VIEW branch_transaction_summary AS
SELECT 
    b.branch_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.transaction_id) AS total_transactions,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_volume
FROM branches b
LEFT JOIN accounts a ON b.branch_id = a.branch_id
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON a.account_id IN (...)
GROUP BY b.branch_name;
```

> "These views make complex queries simple and improve performance by pre-computing common aggregations."

---

## 4. Live Application Demo (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Landing Page
> "Let me show you the live application..."

**Navigate to your deployed URL**

> "Here's our landing page with a modern, professional design. Notice the feature highlights and call-to-action buttons."

**Scroll through the page**

### Step 2: User Authentication
> "Let me login to demonstrate the features..."

**Click Login**
```
Email: alice@example.com
Password: password
```

> "We use Werkzeug's password hashing (PBKDF2-SHA256) for security. Passwords are never stored in plain text."

### Step 3: Dashboard
> "After login, users see their personalized dashboard..."

**Show dashboard features:**
- âœ… Account summary cards
- âœ… Total balance
- âœ… Recent transactions
- âœ… Quick action buttons

> "Notice the real-time balance calculations and the recent transactions below."

### Step 4: Successful Transfer
> "Let me perform a fund transfer..."

**Navigate to Transfer page**

```
From Account: ACC1001 ($5000.00)
To Account: ACC2001
Amount: $500.00
```

**Click Transfer**

> "Success! Notice how the balance updated immediately. Behind the scenes, our stored procedure executed the transfer atomically."

**Navigate to Audit Logs**

> "And here you can see the automatic audit logs created by our trigger. Two entries - one for the debit and one for the credit."

### Step 5: Failure Simulation
> "Now for the interesting part - let me demonstrate our failure recovery mechanism..."

**Click "Simulate Failure" button**

> "I'm attempting to transfer more money than available in the account..."

**Wait for redirect**

> "See? The system prevented the invalid transaction, rolled back all changes, and logged the failure details."

**Show Recovery Logs page**

> "Here in the recovery logs, we can see exactly what failed, why it failed, the amount attempted, and the balance at the time of failure. This is crucial for troubleshooting and compliance."

### Step 6: Reports
> "Finally, let me show you our reporting features..."

**Navigate to Customer Overview**

> "This report uses our database view to show aggregated customer data - total accounts and balances per customer."

**Navigate to Branch Summary**

> "And this view shows branch-level statistics - transaction counts and volumes."

---

## 5. Technical Deep Dive (3 minutes)

### ACID Properties Demonstration

> "Let me demonstrate how our system maintains ACID properties..."

**Open psql or database client**

#### Atomicity
```sql
-- Show how rollback works
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;  -- Shows reduced balance
ROLLBACK;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;  -- Balance restored!
```

> "Atomicity ensures that either ALL operations succeed or NONE do. No partial transactions."

#### Consistency
```sql
-- Try to violate CHECK constraint
UPDATE accounts SET balance = -100 WHERE account_id = 1;
-- ERROR: violates check constraint "chk_balance_non_negative"
```

> "Consistency ensures the database never enters an invalid state. Our constraints prevent this."

#### Isolation
```sql
-- Show locking with FOR UPDATE
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
-- (In another session, try to select same row with FOR UPDATE - it waits!)
```

> "Isolation prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other."

#### Durability
> "Durability is handled by PostgreSQL's WAL (Write-Ahead Logging). Once committed, data persists even after system crashes."

### Real-Time Monitoring
```sql
-- Show recent transactions
SELECT * FROM transactions ORDER BY transaction_date DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Show audit trail
SELECT a.account_number, l.old_balance, l.new_balance, l.changed_at
FROM audit_logs l
JOIN accounts a ON l.account_id = a.account_id
ORDER BY l.changed_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Show system health
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    SUM(balance) as total_deposits
FROM customers c
JOIN accounts a ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id;
```

## 7. Challenges & Solutions (1 minute)

### Challenge 1: Transaction Consistency
**Problem**: Ensuring atomicity across multiple table updates
**Solution**: Stored procedure with explicit transaction control

### Challenge 2: Audit Trail Performance
**Problem**: Triggers adding overhead to every transaction
**Solution**: Optimized trigger that only fires on balance changes

### Challenge 3: Error Handling
**Problem**: Providing useful error messages while maintaining security
**Solution**: Separate error logging (recovery_logs) with sanitized user messages

## 9. Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

#### Q: "Why use a stored procedure instead of just application code?"
**A**: "Stored procedures provide several advantages:
1. **Performance** - Executes directly in database, reducing network overhead
2. **Security** - Can grant execute permission without exposing tables
3. **Consistency** - Logic centralized, prevents duplicate code
4. **Atomicity** - Built-in transaction management"

#### Q: "How does the trigger ensure data consistency?"
**A**: "The trigger fires BEFORE UPDATE, so if the trigger fails, the update is automatically rolled back. Also, it only logs when balance actually changes using the WHEN clause, which improves performance."

#### Q: "What happens if two users transfer from the same account simultaneously?"
**A**: "Great question! We use FOR UPDATE locks in the stored procedure. The first transaction locks the row, and the second waits until the first completes. This prevents race conditions and ensures consistency."

#### Q: "How scalable is this design?"
**A**: "For a learning project, it's well-designed. In production, we'd add:
- Read replicas for reporting queries
- Connection pooling (already using SQLAlchemy)
- Caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Partitioning for large tables (transactions, audit_logs)
- Sharding by customer_id for horizontal scaling"

#### Q: "Why PostgreSQL over MySQL or MongoDB?"
**A**: "PostgreSQL excels at:
- ACID compliance (critical for financial data)
- Advanced features (triggers, stored procedures, views)
- JSON support (additional_details in recovery_logs)
- Strong data integrity with constraints
- Free and open-source"

#### Q: "How do you handle security?"
**A**: "Multiple layers:
- Password hashing with Werkzeug (PBKDF2)
- SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
- Session management with Flask-Login
- HTTPS in production (Render provides free SSL)
- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- Database constraints for data integrity"
